An adjustable contrast fully customisable color scheme for GUI & 8, 16 or 256 color terminals, designed to minimise eyestrain. The main features are:

	- Four color maps:
	    'allblue'   : A colormap with most foreground colors blueish (to
		          minimize contrast etc.)
	    'soft'      : A colormap with foreground colors of similar
		          intensities to reduce eyestrain.
	    'softlight' : A colormap with a bright background (for web
		          hosting etc.)
	    'standard'  : A colormap for use on terminals with only 8/16
			   colors.
	  The first three colormaps will work only on 256 color capable
	  terminals or the GUI. The last one will work anywhere.

	- Adjustable brightness / contrast. Lets you easily adjust the
	  brightness and contrast settings. Extremely useful (for instance)
	  when there is a glare on your monitor, or for long late dim light
	  dim light late at night :)

	- Terminal and GUI support. If you use xterm, rxvt or mrxvt (compiled
	  with 256 colors), then the colors on your terminal will be almost
	  identical to your GUI colors. On any other terminal emulator, a few
	  scripts (included) and parts of this help are designed to help you
	  get the colors you want.

	- LCD / CRT Monitor support. The color response of LCD and CRT
	  monitors is pretty different. This color scheme has an option to
	  adjust colors on CRT monitors to give a similar appearance.

	- Customizable colors. If you find any color unreadable or ugly, you
	  can change it easily. When adjusting the brightness, your custom
	  colors will be suitably adjusted too!

	- Customizable highlighting groups. If you don't like the highlighting
	  of any particular group, you can change it to suit your needs. This
	  is useful for instance if you want the cursor to be brighter than
	  everything else / etc.
